# Sentinel-Script
This script is a universal tool for animating robots in the game Space Engineers. The game has a built in C# API that allows scripts to control in-game vehicles and vehicle components. The script has an implementation for the Sentinel robot, but can be applied to any robot that performs repeating tasks at variable speeds.
